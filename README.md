# Data-Science
This repository contains some projects completed by me for the purpose of self learning/personal interest. Projects are presented in the form of iPython Notebooks with accompanying Python scripts as needed. Python libraries *numpy, pandas, matplotlib*, and *seaborn* are used in almost all of these notebooks.
